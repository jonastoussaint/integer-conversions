ASSIGNMENT: REPRESENTATION 101

Purpose:    Implement C++ programs to convert integers and fractions
            between bases.

KEY PROGRAMS in Codie REPRESENTATION101 project. Your program should
behave pretty much the same.

   base2decimal.crun*
   base2decimalFraction.crun*
   decimal2base.crun*
   decimal2baseFraction.crun*


Your programs (see group assignments):
   base2decimal.cpp - convert base B integer to decimal integer.
   decimal2base.cpp - convert decimal integer to base B integer.

   decimal2baseFraction.cpp - convert decimal fraction to base B fraction.
   base2decimalFraction.cpp - convert base B fraction to decimal fraction.


INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY:

   1. Be able to perform hand calculations.
   2. Be able to write code for at least one integer (fraction) conversion.
